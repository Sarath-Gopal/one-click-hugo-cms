  Rhythm of Kerala is a premier Chendamelam band based in Bangalore, proudly carrying the legacy of Kerala’s vibrant percussion art for over 15 years. Founded by passionate artists dedicated to preserving and evolving this traditional form, our journey began with a vision to bring the soul of Kerala’s rhythms to audiences beyond its borders.

  Over the years, we’ve performed at hundreds of weddings, temple festivals, stage shows, and cultural events across South India and beyond. Our performances combine the authenticity of classical Chendamelam with the energy of modern fusion styles, including Chenda–Violin and Chenda–DJ collaborations.

  What sets us apart is our deep respect for tradition paired with an openness to innovate. Whether it's a spiritual procession or a high-energy celebration, we tailor our performances to suit the occasion—always aiming to leave a lasting impression through rhythm, unity, and unmatched artistry.

  Join us in celebrating Kerala’s musical heartbeat—Rhythm of Kerala, where tradition meets innovation.
